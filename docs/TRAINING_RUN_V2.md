# SecureCLI-Tuner V2 — Training Run Report [DRAFT]

> [!WARNING]
> **PENDING VALIDATION:** This report is currently being re-generated based on a real-world evaluation run on RunPod.
>
> The previous metrics (100% Accuracy) were identified as being potentially simulated due to an evaluation script fallback. We are currently re-running the full evaluation on the `checkpoint-500` model weights to obtain scientifically rigorous results.

## Status: IN-PROGRESS

- [x] Evaluation Script Corrected
- [ ] Real-World Test Set Regeneration
- [ ] Checkpoint-500 Inference Benchmarking
- [ ] Adversarial Robustness Verification (20/20 cases)
